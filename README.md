Fauvism was a lesser known art style in Europe in the early twentieth century, yet it 
had a large impact on the greater art movement that existed in Europe. I coded this 
virtual gallery using HTML to highlight art and artists from the Fauvism movement 
while using CSS to focus on a visually aesthetic appearance to the website.
